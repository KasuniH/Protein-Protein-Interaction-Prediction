# Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction

A machine learning-based approach to predict protein-protein interactions (PPIs) using sequence features. This project is a part of computational biology research and aims to classify PPI pairs efficiently based on various biological descriptors.
## 🧬 Overview

Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) play a crucial role in cellular functions. This project builds a classification model using machine learning to predict whether a pair of proteins interacts, based on their primary amino acid sequences.

## 🚀 Features

- Extraction of sequence-based features using Biopython
- Feature engineering: AAC, DPC, CTD, etc.
- Train-test split and preprocessing
- Classification using ML models (Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization of metrics and feature importance

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Biopython, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Data Source:** Custom or public PPI datasets in FASTA/CSV format
